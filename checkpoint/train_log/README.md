- yaml file is required to build the model architecture
- pth file is the model checkpoint used in the challenge

The full path should be 
```
config_path=$PWD/checkpoint/train_log/slurm_8gpus_4nodes_cocoformer/output/config.yaml 
checkpoint_path=$PWD/checkpoint/train_log/slurm_8gpus_4nodes_cocoformer/output/model_0064999.pth
```
